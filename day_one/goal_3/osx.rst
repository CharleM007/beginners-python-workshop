Mac OS X
========

Start Python
------------

* Start up a Terminal command prompt. You can find the Terminal application through Spotlight, or navigate to Applications/Utilities/Terminal.
* To start Python, type::

    python
    Python 2.7.1 (r261:67515, Feb 11 2010, 00:51:29) 
    [GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5646)] on darwin
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>>

:note:

    The >>> indicates that you are at a Python prompt.

* Exit the Python prompt by typing::

    exit()

Now you're back at the OS X command prompt (which looks something like username$).

Success!

Practice these steps until you feel comfortable navigating to a command prompt, starting Python, and exiting Python.
