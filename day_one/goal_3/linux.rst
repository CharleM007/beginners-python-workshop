Start Python
------------

Linux ships with Python installed, so the goal of this page is to make sure you can start a terminal and run Python from the command line.

* Open a Terminal command prompt. You can find the Terminal application at Applications/Accessories/Terminal, or it may already be on your menu bar.
* To start Python, type::

    python
    Python 2.7.1 (r252:60911, Jan 24 2011, 17:44:40) 
    [GCC 4.3.2] on linux2
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> 

:note:

    The >>> indicates that you are at a Python prompt.

* Exit the Python prompt by typing::

    exit()

Now you're back at the Linux command prompt (which looks something like username$).

Success!
--------

Practice these steps until you feel comfortable navigating to a command prompt, starting Python, and exiting Python.
